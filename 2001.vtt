WEBVTT

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:26.671
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.019
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.524
Are the rumors true, Albus?

00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:52.030
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:55.491
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

00:01:55.742 --> 00:01:59.662
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:04.667
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:28.066
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:32.153
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:36.824
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:40.078
Try not to wake him.

00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:42.997
There you go.

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.924
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.429
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.600
- They really are--
- The only family he has.

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:07.814
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:09.774
Exactly.

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.278
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.450
Until he's ready.

00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:36.968
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.481
Good luck...

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:53.484
...Harry Potter.

00:04:11.085 --> 00:04:14.130
Up. Get up!

00:04:16.674 --> 00:04:18.176
Now!

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:35.276
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

00:04:46.454 --> 00:04:51.709
- Here comes the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

00:04:53.544 --> 00:04:56.714
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

00:04:56.964 --> 00:05:01.928
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

00:05:02.136 --> 00:05:05.056
...for my Dudley's special day!

00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:10.228
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.565
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:20.238
- How many are there?
-36. Counted them myself.

00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:23.699
36?! But last year I had 37!

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:27.745
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.498
This is what we're going to do.

00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:35.086
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:42.385
It should be a lovely day
at the zoo. I'm looking forward to it.

00:05:45.972 --> 00:05:47.765
I'm warning you now, boy.

00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:51.519
Any funny business, any at all...

00:05:51.727 --> 00:05:54.772
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.275
Get in.

00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:06.868
Make it move.

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:11.247
Move!

00:06:11.497 --> 00:06:13.958
- Move!
- He's asleep!

00:06:14.125 --> 00:06:16.711
He's boring.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:24.635
Sorry about him. He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:28.890
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

00:06:31.642 --> 00:06:34.312
Can you hear me?

00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:40.818
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.737
Do you...?

00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:47.074
Do you talk to people often?

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.495
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:53.998
Do you miss your family?

00:06:56.834 --> 00:07:01.589
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

00:07:01.797 --> 00:07:06.802
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:31.869
Thanks.

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.537
Anytime.

00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:38.793
Snake!

00:07:54.225 --> 00:07:57.603
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:00.982
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

00:08:01.482 --> 00:08:06.570
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:16.747
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:21.419
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:25.506
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

00:08:29.927 --> 00:08:32.722
There's no such thing as magic.

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:12.178
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

00:09:12.386 --> 00:09:15.598
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!

00:09:15.806 --> 00:09:18.559
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.345
No more mail through this letterbox.

00:10:06.524 --> 00:10:09.360
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:14.949
Shoo! Go on.

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:42.685
Fine day, Sunday.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.982
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.570
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.573
No post on Sunday.

00:10:56.991 --> 00:11:00.911
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:06.417
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

00:11:14.884 --> 00:11:18.762
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

00:11:30.274 --> 00:11:32.443
Make it stop, please!

00:11:34.278 --> 00:11:36.197
Stop it!

00:11:40.326 --> 00:11:43.287
Mummy, what's happening?

00:11:46.707 --> 00:11:51.045
Give me that! Give me that letter!

00:11:53.631 --> 00:11:55.424
Get off!

00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:03.349
They're my letters! Let go of me!

00:12:04.141 --> 00:12:07.144
That's it! We're going away!

00:12:07.853 --> 00:12:11.482
Far away, where they can't find us!

00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:14.985
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

00:12:49.895 --> 00:12:52.189
Make a wish, Harry.

00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:10.332
Who's there?

00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.930
Sorry about that.

00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:36.400
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

00:13:39.236 --> 00:13:42.072
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:50.831
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.586
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:58.589
I'm not Harry.

00:14:00.466 --> 00:14:04.178
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.555
Got something for you.

00:14:06.764 --> 00:14:12.353
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:18.275
Baked it myself, words and all.

00:14:23.781 --> 00:14:24.865
Thank you.

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:29.244
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:48.555
Excuse me, but who are you?

00:14:48.764 --> 00:14:53.644
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

00:14:53.936 --> 00:14:57.648
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

00:14:58.232 --> 00:15:03.153
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:04.780
Learned what?

00:15:04.988 --> 00:15:07.533
You're a wizard, Harry.

00:15:08.742 --> 00:15:10.786
-Iâ€™m a what?
- A wizard.

00:15:10.994 --> 00:15:14.039
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:17.167
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:20.337
...l can't be a wizard.

00:15:21.046 --> 00:15:25.801
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:30.848
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

00:15:31.098 --> 00:15:35.769
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:39.022
<i>Hm.</i>

00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:55.289
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:58.709
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:03.881
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

00:16:04.131 --> 00:16:08.343
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:11.638
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

00:16:11.847 --> 00:16:15.559
My perfect sister being who she was.

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:21.732
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:26.111
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.990
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

00:16:30.199 --> 00:16:31.909
A freak!

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:35.120
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:41.043
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

00:16:41.251 --> 00:16:46.256
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

00:16:46.423 --> 00:16:50.427
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:55.015
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

00:16:55.224 --> 00:16:59.144
We had to say something.
- lt's an outrage! A scandal!

00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:01.772
He'll not be going.

00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:05.359
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

00:17:05.526 --> 00:17:06.568
Muggle?

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:10.906
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:14.952
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

00:17:15.202 --> 00:17:21.124
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:26.129
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:30.884
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:33.136
...in front of me.

00:17:50.988 --> 00:17:56.285
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

00:17:56.493 --> 00:18:00.622
- Iâ€™m not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

00:18:01.915 --> 00:18:04.918
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

00:18:11.091 --> 00:18:14.303
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

00:18:29.359 --> 00:18:31.862
"All students must be equipped with...

00:18:32.112 --> 00:18:35.032
...one standard size <i>2</i>
pewter cauldron...

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.038
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

00:18:41.288 --> 00:18:43.874
Can we find all this in London?

00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:46.460
If you know where to go.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:12.194
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:16.281
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.576
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

00:19:19.826 --> 00:19:23.372
Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter!

00:19:27.668 --> 00:19:31.088
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

00:19:31.338 --> 00:19:35.676
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:41.390
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:44.101
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

00:19:44.351 --> 00:19:49.356
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

00:19:49.564 --> 00:19:51.942
Oh, nice to meet you.

00:19:52.234 --> 00:19:55.320
Fearfully fascinating subject.

00:19:55.529 --> 00:20:00.117
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:05.247
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.207
Goodbye.

00:20:09.918 --> 00:20:13.463
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?

00:20:13.714 --> 00:20:17.134
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:21.138
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

00:20:38.155 --> 00:20:41.950
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.802
Here, you get your quills and ink.

00:21:01.011 --> 00:21:04.973
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.042
It's a world-class racing broom.

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:36.171
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:39.716
It's the fastest model yet.

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:48.016
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:51.561
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

00:21:51.812 --> 00:21:57.317
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:13.959
Hagrid, what exactly are these things?

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:19.422
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

00:22:19.589 --> 00:22:21.591
Best stay close.

00:22:25.595 --> 00:22:29.266
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.690
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:40.861
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

00:22:43.697 --> 00:22:46.533
Ha! There's the little devil.

00:22:46.741 --> 00:22:49.619
And there's something else as well.

00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:54.207
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

00:22:58.253 --> 00:23:03.300
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

00:23:04.634 --> 00:23:06.595
Very well.

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:14.644
Vault 687.

00:23:16.563 --> 00:23:18.815
Lamp, please.

00:23:27.324 --> 00:23:28.658
Key, please.

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.852
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

00:23:57.187 --> 00:24:00.857
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

00:24:01.107 --> 00:24:05.278
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

00:24:05.528 --> 00:24:07.072
Stand back.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.144
Best not to mention this to anyone.

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:50.490
I still need a wand.

00:24:50.699 --> 00:24:54.119
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

00:24:54.828 --> 00:24:59.916
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:19.769
Hello?

00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:24.566
Hello?

00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:32.365
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:42.375
It seems only yesterday...

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:48.465
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:57.432
Here we are.

00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.568
Give it a wave.

00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:17.577
Apparently not.

00:26:25.001 --> 00:26:27.212
Perhaps...

00:26:28.838 --> 00:26:31.007
...this.

00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:42.727
No, no, definitely not. No matter.

00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:51.528
I wonder...

00:27:20.765 --> 00:27:23.059
Curious.

00:27:23.268 --> 00:27:26.187
Very curious.

00:27:26.396 --> 00:27:29.524
Sorry, but what's curious?

00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:34.529
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

00:27:34.737 --> 00:27:37.490
It so happens that the phoenix...

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:42.412
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:45.915
Just one other.

00:27:46.082 --> 00:27:50.420
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

00:27:50.712 --> 00:27:56.384
...when its brother gave you that scar.

00:27:58.219 --> 00:28:01.431
And who owned that wand?

00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:04.684
We do not speak his name.

00:28:05.101 --> 00:28:08.605
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:11.858
It's not always clear why.

00:28:12.233 --> 00:28:15.737
But I think it is clear...

00:28:15.945 --> 00:28:19.866
...that we can expect
great things from you.

00:28:20.074 --> 00:28:24.329
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

00:28:24.579 --> 00:28:27.248
...did great things.

00:28:27.457 --> 00:28:29.459
Terrible...

00:28:29.918 --> 00:28:33.129
...yes, but great.

00:28:38.801 --> 00:28:40.845
Harry! Harry!

00:28:41.221 --> 00:28:43.598
Happy birthday.

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:46.142
Wow.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:54.234
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

00:28:54.609 --> 00:29:00.156
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

00:29:00.406 --> 00:29:03.993
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

00:29:07.914 --> 00:29:12.460
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:15.171
Not all wizards are good.

00:29:15.421 --> 00:29:17.924
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

00:29:18.132 --> 00:29:23.137
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

00:29:23.346 --> 00:29:26.975
- His name was V--
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

00:29:27.183 --> 00:29:29.018
No, I can't spell it.

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:33.523
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.150
Shh.

00:29:37.485 --> 00:29:39.696
It was dark times, Harry.

00:29:42.031 --> 00:29:45.159
<i>Voldemort started
to gather some followers.</i>

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.705
<i>Brought them over to the Dark Side.</i>

00:29:50.123 --> 00:29:53.209
<i>Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.</i>

00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:57.422
<i>Your parents fought against him.</i>

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.426
<i>But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.</i>

00:30:05.805 --> 00:30:08.391
<i>Nobody, not one.</i>

00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:10.977
<i>Except you.</i>

00:30:12.979 --> 00:30:17.066
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

00:30:17.567 --> 00:30:21.738
Yes. That ain't no ordinary out
on your forehead, Harry.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:27.744
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

00:30:27.994 --> 00:30:31.581
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

00:30:32.749 --> 00:30:36.085
Well, some say he died.

00:30:36.336 --> 00:30:38.755
Codswallop, in my opinion.

00:30:38.963 --> 00:30:42.216
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

00:30:42.425 --> 00:30:45.386
...too tired to carry on.

00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:51.017
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

00:30:51.267 --> 00:30:55.521
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.609
You're the boy who lived.

00:31:08.993 --> 00:31:11.704
What are you looking at?

00:31:13.456 --> 00:31:15.458
Blimey, is that the time?

00:31:15.625 --> 00:31:19.629
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

00:31:19.879 --> 00:31:24.759
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:30.306
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

00:31:33.142 --> 00:31:35.436
"Platform 9 3/4"?

00:31:35.645 --> 00:31:40.441
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.986
There's no such thing, is there?

00:32:02.505 --> 00:32:04.090
Sorry.

00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.344
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:32:08.553 --> 00:32:10.096
On your left.

00:32:10.346 --> 00:32:14.142
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:16.853
Think you're being funny, do you?

00:32:17.103 --> 00:32:20.440
It's the same
every year, packed with Muggles.

00:32:20.857 --> 00:32:24.277
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

00:32:29.949 --> 00:32:33.119
All right, Percy, you first.

00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:44.297
Fred, you next.

00:32:44.505 --> 00:32:48.217
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?

00:32:48.384 --> 00:32:50.386
I'm sorry, George.

00:32:54.515 --> 00:32:56.893
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

00:33:02.732 --> 00:33:05.318
Excuse me.

00:33:06.402 --> 00:33:09.197
Could you tell me how to...?

00:33:09.405 --> 00:33:12.909
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:15.620
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

00:33:15.828 --> 00:33:21.751
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

00:33:21.918 --> 00:33:25.421
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

00:34:22.979 --> 00:34:27.275
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.694
Not at all.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.199
I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:38.077
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

00:34:39.453 --> 00:34:41.497
So it's true!

00:34:41.706 --> 00:34:44.500
I mean, do you really have the...?

00:34:45.084 --> 00:34:47.962
- The what?
- The scar?

00:34:48.462 --> 00:34:50.506
Oh, yeah.

00:34:51.132 --> 00:34:53.342
Wicked!

00:34:55.803 --> 00:35:00.975
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

00:35:05.021 --> 00:35:07.315
We'll take the lot.

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.360
Whoa.

00:35:18.034 --> 00:35:22.830
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

00:35:23.247 --> 00:35:26.626
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

00:35:26.834 --> 00:35:30.671
...spinach, liver and tripe.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.051
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

00:35:39.722 --> 00:35:45.061
- Are they real frogs?
-lt's a spell. You want the cards.

00:35:45.269 --> 00:35:50.733
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

00:35:52.234 --> 00:35:54.528
Watch it!

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.326
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

00:36:03.204 --> 00:36:07.083
-Iâ€™ve got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

00:36:08.876 --> 00:36:10.419
Hey, he's gone!

00:36:10.586 --> 00:36:14.090
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:17.843
This is Scabbers. Pathetic, isn't he?

00:36:18.052 --> 00:36:19.220
A little.

00:36:19.428 --> 00:36:22.765
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

00:36:22.932 --> 00:36:25.017
Yeah.

00:36:31.774 --> 00:36:33.401
Has anyone seen a toad?

00:36:33.776 --> 00:36:36.445
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

00:36:37.029 --> 00:36:41.367
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:46.747
<i>Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow</i>

00:36:46.956 --> 00:36:50.084
<i>Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow</i>

00:36:52.837 --> 00:36:58.467
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:01.929
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:04.765
...but they've all worked for me.

00:37:08.394 --> 00:37:10.438
For example:

00:37:10.813 --> 00:37:13.607
<i>Oculus Reparo.</i>

00:37:15.651 --> 00:37:18.320
That's better, isn't it?

00:37:19.488 --> 00:37:23.409
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

00:37:23.617 --> 00:37:27.163
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

00:37:27.913 --> 00:37:31.125
-Iâ€™m Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

00:37:31.333 --> 00:37:36.422
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

00:37:40.509 --> 00:37:44.013
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:46.182
Just there.

00:37:58.527 --> 00:38:02.323
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

00:38:02.531 --> 00:38:07.703
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.713
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.

00:38:17.922 --> 00:38:18.964
Whoa.

00:38:19.131 --> 00:38:23.135
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

00:38:51.914 --> 00:38:53.374
Wow.

00:39:08.848 --> 00:39:10.599
Wicked.

00:39:38.794 --> 00:39:41.046
Welcome to Hogwarts.

00:39:41.255 --> 00:39:45.259
Shortly, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

00:39:45.467 --> 00:39:50.514
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

00:39:50.723 --> 00:39:53.809
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

00:39:54.059 --> 00:39:58.522
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

00:39:58.939 --> 00:40:03.986
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

00:40:04.612 --> 00:40:08.115
Your triumphs will earn you points.

00:40:08.324 --> 00:40:12.453
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

00:40:12.661 --> 00:40:17.958
At the end of the year, the house with
the most points wins the house cup.

00:40:18.167 --> 00:40:19.501
Trevor!

00:40:28.427 --> 00:40:30.054
Sorry.

00:40:30.262 --> 00:40:34.183
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:38.854
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:41.941
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

00:40:42.149 --> 00:40:43.567
Harry Potter?

00:40:44.193 --> 00:40:46.862
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

00:40:47.071 --> 00:40:49.365
And I'm Malfoy.

00:40:49.698 --> 00:40:52.034
Draco Malfoy.

00:40:53.994 --> 00:40:57.581
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:03.587
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:08.550
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

00:41:08.717 --> 00:41:12.554
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

00:41:12.721 --> 00:41:14.890
I can help you there.

00:41:17.142 --> 00:41:20.980
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.821
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

00:41:47.423 --> 00:41:51.927
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

00:41:52.261 --> 00:41:55.139
I read about it
in Hogwarts, <i>A</i> History.

00:42:08.402 --> 00:42:11.238
Will you wait along here, please?

00:42:12.656 --> 00:42:15.451
Now, before we begin...

00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:18.912
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

00:42:19.121 --> 00:42:23.917
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

00:42:24.293 --> 00:42:26.420
The first years, please note...

00:42:26.712 --> 00:42:32.718
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

00:42:32.968 --> 00:42:38.474
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

00:42:38.682 --> 00:42:43.312
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

00:42:43.604 --> 00:42:47.816
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

00:42:49.193 --> 00:42:51.153
Thank you.

00:42:52.905 --> 00:42:56.992
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

00:42:57.201 --> 00:43:00.829
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

00:43:00.996 --> 00:43:04.249
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

00:43:04.458 --> 00:43:07.086
Hermione Granger.

00:43:09.338 --> 00:43:11.965
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

00:43:12.341 --> 00:43:15.719
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

00:43:20.224 --> 00:43:25.020
Ah, right, then. Mm, right.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.857
Okay. Gryffindor!

00:43:37.658 --> 00:43:40.452
Draco Malfoy.

00:43:44.998 --> 00:43:47.209
Slytherin!

00:43:48.168 --> 00:43:51.046
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:53.841
Susan Bones.

00:44:00.806 --> 00:44:02.224
Ah!

00:44:02.391 --> 00:44:04.518
Harry, what is it?

00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:07.479
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:09.148
Let's see...

00:44:09.398 --> 00:44:13.735
I know! Hufflepuff!

00:44:15.487 --> 00:44:17.906
Ronald Weasley.

00:44:30.752 --> 00:44:36.758
Ha, another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

00:44:37.426 --> 00:44:39.761
Gryffindor!

00:44:45.934 --> 00:44:48.437
Harry Potter.

00:45:05.579 --> 00:45:09.541
Hm, difficult, very difficult.

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.712
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

00:45:13.921 --> 00:45:16.215
There's talent, oh, yes.

00:45:16.423 --> 00:45:20.260
And a thirst to prove yourself.

00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:22.638
But where to put you?

00:45:23.222 --> 00:45:25.724
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

00:45:25.974 --> 00:45:29.603
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

00:45:29.811 --> 00:45:34.650
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:40.239
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

00:45:40.572 --> 00:45:45.160
- No? Well, if you're sure.
- Please, no.

00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:47.162
Better be...

00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:49.331
...Gryffindor!

00:46:14.856 --> 00:46:17.651
Your attention, please.

00:46:19.695 --> 00:46:22.406
Let the feast begin.

00:46:27.411 --> 00:46:29.538
Wow.

00:46:39.339 --> 00:46:40.882
I'm half and half.

00:46:41.049 --> 00:46:44.344
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

00:46:44.553 --> 00:46:48.056
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

00:46:49.057 --> 00:46:52.853
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

00:46:53.186 --> 00:46:56.315
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

00:46:56.523 --> 00:46:58.442
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:04.239
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

00:47:08.744 --> 00:47:11.079
Hello! How are you?

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.708
Welcome to Gryffindor.

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.262
It's the Bloody Baron!

00:47:31.933 --> 00:47:34.728
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

00:47:34.936 --> 00:47:40.359
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

00:47:43.403 --> 00:47:46.281
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:49.284
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

00:47:49.493 --> 00:47:52.996
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

00:47:53.288 --> 00:47:55.290
Like this.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:09.137
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:13.642
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

00:48:13.934 --> 00:48:17.270
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

00:48:17.479 --> 00:48:21.650
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

00:48:30.784 --> 00:48:36.581
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.459
That picture's moving.

00:48:39.668 --> 00:48:43.171
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

00:48:44.923 --> 00:48:47.259
- Look!
- Who's that girl?

00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:50.011
Welcome to Hogwarts.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.764
Who's that?

00:49:06.027 --> 00:49:07.612
Password?

00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:10.866
Caput Draconis.

00:49:12.868 --> 00:49:15.162
Wow.

00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:22.502
Follow me, everyone.
Keep up. Quickly, come on.

00:49:25.213 --> 00:49:27.632
Gather around here.

00:49:29.342 --> 00:49:32.637
Welcome to the Gryffindor
common room.

00:49:32.846 --> 00:49:37.225
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

00:49:37.476 --> 00:49:40.604
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

00:50:48.797 --> 00:50:50.423
Made it!

00:50:50.632 --> 00:50:55.053
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

00:50:58.306 --> 00:51:03.270
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.

00:51:03.478 --> 00:51:07.774
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

00:51:07.983 --> 00:51:11.194
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

00:51:11.403 --> 00:51:17.158
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:31.006
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

00:51:31.214 --> 00:51:34.843
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

00:51:35.093 --> 00:51:38.805
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

00:51:39.014 --> 00:51:42.100
However, for those select few...

00:51:43.018 --> 00:51:46.354
...who possess the predisposition...

00:51:50.025 --> 00:51:53.320
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

00:51:53.528 --> 00:51:56.448
...and ensnare the senses.

00:51:56.656 --> 00:51:59.200
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

00:51:59.367 --> 00:52:05.332
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

00:52:09.377 --> 00:52:14.257
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

00:52:14.466 --> 00:52:20.388
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

00:52:20.639 --> 00:52:23.558
...to not pay attention.

00:52:29.564 --> 00:52:32.150
Mr. Potter.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.197
Our new celebrity.

00:52:39.366 --> 00:52:45.163
What would I get if I added root of
asphodel to an infusion of Wormwood?

00:52:48.416 --> 00:52:50.835
You don't know? Let's try again.

00:52:51.044 --> 00:52:55.674
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

00:52:56.925 --> 00:52:58.343
I don't know, sir.

00:52:58.593 --> 00:53:02.430
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

00:53:05.016 --> 00:53:07.268
I don't know, sir.

00:53:08.353 --> 00:53:09.604
Pity.

00:53:11.356 --> 00:53:15.568
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

00:53:16.277 --> 00:53:17.278
...is it, Mr. Potter?

00:53:21.282 --> 00:53:26.913
<i>Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum</i>

00:53:28.123 --> 00:53:29.624
<i>Eye of rabbit...</i>

00:53:29.958 --> 00:53:32.627
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

00:53:32.919 --> 00:53:37.632
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

00:53:44.139 --> 00:53:46.266
Mail's here.

00:54:18.506 --> 00:54:21.509
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.640
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

00:54:27.849 --> 00:54:33.354
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

00:54:33.688 --> 00:54:37.025
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

00:54:37.358 --> 00:54:40.779
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

00:54:40.987 --> 00:54:44.657
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

00:54:44.908 --> 00:54:50.622
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:56.544
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

00:54:56.711 --> 00:55:01.007
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

00:55:09.933 --> 00:55:13.686
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

00:55:13.895 --> 00:55:16.689
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

00:55:17.982 --> 00:55:20.443
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

00:55:20.652 --> 00:55:24.572
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

00:55:24.739 --> 00:55:30.370
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

00:55:30.578 --> 00:55:32.539
Up!

00:55:32.747 --> 00:55:37.085
,UP'
,UP'

00:55:38.753 --> 00:55:40.380
Up. Up!

00:55:40.588 --> 00:55:42.590
With feeling.

00:55:42.757 --> 00:55:43.842
Up!

00:55:44.092 --> 00:55:45.760
-Up. Up.
-Up. Up.

00:55:48.388 --> 00:55:50.348
Um on!

00:55:51.266 --> 00:55:53.393
Shut up, Harry.

00:55:53.601 --> 00:55:58.273
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

00:55:58.481 --> 00:56:02.485
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

00:56:02.861 --> 00:56:07.782
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

00:56:08.032 --> 00:56:11.870
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

00:56:12.078 --> 00:56:16.374
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

00:56:16.624 --> 00:56:19.752
On my whistle. Three, two...

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:23.548
Mr. Longbottom.

00:56:28.136 --> 00:56:31.055
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

00:56:31.264 --> 00:56:32.515
Neville!

00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:38.897
Come back down this instant!

00:56:48.823 --> 00:56:51.326
Mr. Longbo--

00:57:00.001 --> 00:57:02.754
Whoa!

00:57:06.674 --> 00:57:07.675
Ow!

00:57:07.842 --> 00:57:10.261
Everyone out of the way!

00:57:15.808 --> 00:57:17.977
Is he all right?

00:57:18.353 --> 00:57:24.025
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

00:57:25.318 --> 00:57:29.989
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

00:57:30.198 --> 00:57:33.868
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

00:57:34.077 --> 00:57:39.332
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:41.459
Did you see his face?

00:57:41.668 --> 00:57:45.505
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

00:57:45.713 --> 00:57:48.216
Give it here, Malfoy.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:52.720
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

00:57:56.891 --> 00:57:59.394
How about on the roof?

00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:04.399
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

00:58:06.901 --> 00:58:10.738
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

00:58:10.905 --> 00:58:13.866
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

00:58:14.158 --> 00:58:16.077
What an idiot.

00:58:19.414 --> 00:58:22.917
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

00:58:23.167 --> 00:58:25.253
Is that so?

00:58:28.423 --> 00:58:30.717
Have it your way, then.

00:59:03.458 --> 00:59:07.086
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

00:59:07.295 --> 00:59:09.297
Harry Potter!

00:59:10.298 --> 00:59:12.300
Follow me.

00:59:23.978 --> 00:59:26.230
You wait here.

00:59:27.982 --> 00:59:33.279
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

00:59:33.488 --> 00:59:35.323
Yes, of course.

00:59:40.995 --> 00:59:46.751
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

00:59:48.836 --> 00:59:52.340
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.801
I always knew he'd do well.

00:59:55.259 --> 00:59:59.305
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

00:59:59.514 --> 01:00:04.352
- You must be the youngest player in--
- A century, McGonagall says.

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.854
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

01:00:07.021 --> 01:00:09.524
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

01:00:09.774 --> 01:00:13.486
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:16.364
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:20.535
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:23.496
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

01:00:23.746 --> 01:00:29.377
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

01:00:29.544 --> 01:00:32.797
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

01:00:33.214 --> 01:00:38.010
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:44.892
Whoa.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:50.398
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:53.401
I didn't know.

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:02.535
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.037
Who doesn't?

01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:08.082
What's happening?

01:01:08.291 --> 01:01:12.503
The staircases change, remember?

01:01:17.925 --> 01:01:22.430
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

01:01:30.062 --> 01:01:33.441
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.860
We're not supposed to be here.

01:01:36.068 --> 01:01:39.947
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:42.742
Let's go.

01:01:44.952 --> 01:01:47.830
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:54.962
Quick, let's hide through that door!

01:02:00.092 --> 01:02:02.136
-It's locked!
- We're done for!

01:02:02.345 --> 01:02:04.472
Move over!

01:02:05.473 --> 01:02:07.600
<i>Alohomora.</i>

01:02:08.476 --> 01:02:10.394
Get in.

01:02:11.646 --> 01:02:12.730
<i>Alohomora?</i>

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:15.483
<i>Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.</i>

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:19.070
Anyone here, my sweet?

01:02:25.284 --> 01:02:26.327
Come on.

01:02:27.119 --> 01:02:29.747
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:33.501
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:04.699
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

01:03:04.907 --> 01:03:08.536
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

01:03:08.786 --> 01:03:12.957
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

01:03:13.165 --> 01:03:16.043
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:19.922
It was standing on
a trap door. It wasn't there by accident.

01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:23.676
-It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:27.847
That's right. Now, if you two
don't mind, I'm going to bed...

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:31.684
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:35.021
Or worse, expelled.

01:03:38.232 --> 01:03:42.528
She needs to sort out her priorities.

01:03:47.158 --> 01:03:51.370
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:57.251
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:06.510
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:12.683
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:17.271
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.942
I think so. What are those?

01:04:24.236 --> 01:04:26.405
You better take this.

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:39.251
Careful now, it's coming back.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.470
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

01:04:51.639 --> 01:04:53.724
Uh-oh.

01:05:06.112 --> 01:05:08.406
What was that?

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:12.910
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

01:05:13.119 --> 01:05:16.622
But you are a Seeker.

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:24.797
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

01:05:25.047 --> 01:05:27.550
The Golden Snitch.

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:30.761
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:34.974
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

01:05:35.182 --> 01:05:37.143
What do I do with it?

01:05:37.351 --> 01:05:40.604
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:43.315
You catch this, the game's over.

01:05:43.524 --> 01:05:47.486
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:55.369
Whoa.

01:05:56.537 --> 01:06:01.876
One of a Wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

01:06:02.084 --> 01:06:06.046
...or the ability to make objects fly.

01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:08.674
Do you have your feathers? Good.

01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:14.054
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:17.600
The swish and flick. Everyone.

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:23.731
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:28.736
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go,</i> then.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.323
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:06:32.573 --> 01:06:34.909
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:06:35.117 --> 01:06:38.579
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:43.000
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:49.215
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

01:06:49.757 --> 01:06:54.011
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:58.349
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:11.445
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:13.364
Splendid!

01:07:14.949 --> 01:07:17.117
Well done, dear.

01:07:21.372 --> 01:07:25.459
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

01:07:31.966 --> 01:07:36.220
<i>"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."</i>

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:41.809
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

01:07:42.476 --> 01:07:44.979
I think she heard you.

01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:15.759
Where's Hermione?

01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:19.096
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

01:08:19.305 --> 01:08:23.350
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:31.483
Troll in the dungeon!

01:08:31.734 --> 01:08:35.029
Troll in the dungeon!

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:40.200
Thought you ought to know.

01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:49.877
Silence!

01:08:51.503 --> 01:08:55.549
Everyone will please not panic!

01:08:56.216 --> 01:08:57.801
Now...

01:08:58.010 --> 01:09:02.556
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

01:09:03.265 --> 01:09:08.062
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:22.284
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

01:09:22.493 --> 01:09:24.244
How could a troll get in?

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:29.583
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

01:09:29.833 --> 01:09:33.837
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

01:09:45.933 --> 01:09:49.186
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

01:09:53.065 --> 01:09:55.234
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.642
Hermione, move!

01:10:31.979 --> 01:10:36.150
Help! Help!

01:10:38.152 --> 01:10:40.237
Hey, pea brain!

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:54.501
Help!

01:10:57.254 --> 01:10:58.756
Whoa!

01:11:07.014 --> 01:11:08.432
Ugh.

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:18.025
Do something!

01:11:19.485 --> 01:11:23.447
- What?
- Anything!

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:26.492
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:29.036
<i>Wingardium Leviosa.</i>

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:41.965
Cool.

01:12:06.365 --> 01:12:09.201
Is it dead?

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:13.330
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:21.922
Ugh. Troll boogers.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:27.970
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

01:12:28.178 --> 01:12:32.766
- Well, what it is--
-lt's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

01:12:34.977 --> 01:12:36.186
Miss Granger?

01:12:37.062 --> 01:12:42.109
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.236
But I was wrong.

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:49.491
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:54.913
McGONAGALL: Be that as it may,
it was an extremely foolish thing to do.

01:12:55.122 --> 01:13:00.794
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

01:13:01.003 --> 01:13:04.006
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

01:13:04.214 --> 01:13:07.801
...for your serious lack of judgment.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.262
As for you two gentlemen...

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:13.891
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:17.519
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

01:13:17.728 --> 01:13:20.314
...and live to tell the tale.

01:13:20.606 --> 01:13:23.025
Five points...

01:13:24.401 --> 01:13:27.529
...will be awarded to each of you...

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:32.159
...for sheer dumb luck.

01:13:37.789 --> 01:13:41.543
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:52.095
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

01:13:52.304 --> 01:13:55.515
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

01:13:55.682 --> 01:13:57.935
I'm not hungry.

01:13:58.518 --> 01:14:04.149
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

01:14:04.358 --> 01:14:07.527
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:10.864
Even if it is against Slytherin.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:21.959
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:26.505
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:29.383
...so he could get past that dog.

01:14:29.591 --> 01:14:32.344
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:34.805
But why would anyone go near that dog?

01:14:35.472 --> 01:14:38.725
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:42.187
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

01:14:42.354 --> 01:14:43.522
You're saying--

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:48.235
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

01:15:01.373 --> 01:15:05.335
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:07.421
Let's open it.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:18.849
It's a broomstick.

01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:23.770
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:27.274
But who--?

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.423
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:55.302
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

01:15:55.469 --> 01:15:58.972
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.

01:15:59.306 --> 01:16:01.975
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

01:16:02.184 --> 01:16:04.978
Woke up in hospital a week later.

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:30.587
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

01:16:30.796 --> 01:16:35.175
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

01:16:40.347 --> 01:16:42.182
Gryffindor!

01:17:05.789 --> 01:17:08.250
The players take their positions...

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:12.254
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:15.799
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

01:17:16.383 --> 01:17:18.844
...from all of you!

01:17:23.974 --> 01:17:26.893
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

01:17:27.060 --> 01:17:29.813
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:33.817
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

01:17:39.906 --> 01:17:44.077
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:07.559
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:12.063
Yes-- Whoa.

01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:14.024
Well done!

01:18:18.403 --> 01:18:24.117
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:58.944
- Yes!
- Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.626
Give me that!

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:48.702
Take that side!

01:20:35.874 --> 01:20:37.667
Whoa. Whoa!

01:20:38.168 --> 01:20:41.421
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

01:20:50.347 --> 01:20:52.557
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

01:20:52.766 --> 01:20:57.103
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:20.460
Come on, Hermione!

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:38.311
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:48.446
Fire! You're on fire!

01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:08.466
Go, go, go, go!

01:23:00.477 --> 01:23:02.812
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

01:23:03.897 --> 01:23:05.356
He's got the Snitch!

01:23:05.565 --> 01:23:09.652
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

01:23:09.861 --> 01:23:11.529
Gryffindor wins!

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:17.660
Oh, no.

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:21.706
Yes!

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:59.369
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:03.456
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:06.125
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

01:24:06.292 --> 01:24:09.963
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.

01:24:10.171 --> 01:24:14.759
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

01:24:14.926 --> 01:24:15.969
Yes?

01:24:16.177 --> 01:24:20.306
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:24.894
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

01:24:25.103 --> 01:24:28.565
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

01:24:29.065 --> 01:24:34.153
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:37.949
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:40.410
Exactly.

01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:43.830
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:48.710
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

01:24:48.918 --> 01:24:54.007
What that dog is guarding is between
Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

01:24:54.215 --> 01:24:55.633
Nicholas Flamel?

01:24:56.634 --> 01:25:01.347
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

01:25:01.514 --> 01:25:05.643
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

01:25:05.852 --> 01:25:07.854
I don't know.

01:25:26.706 --> 01:25:29.542
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

01:25:29.792 --> 01:25:32.545
<i>Ring the Hogwart bell</i>

01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:35.548
<i>Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas</i>

01:25:35.798 --> 01:25:38.718
<i>Cast a Christmas spell</i>

01:25:52.315 --> 01:25:55.652
Knight to e5.

01:26:03.326 --> 01:26:05.495
Queen to e5.

01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:12.543
That's totally barbaric!

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:16.714
That's Wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

01:26:16.923 --> 01:26:18.383
I see you haven't.

01:26:18.758 --> 01:26:23.888
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

01:26:24.097 --> 01:26:27.934
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.

01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:31.521
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

01:26:31.729 --> 01:26:35.233
We've looked a hundred times!

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:41.114
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:46.244
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

01:26:48.788 --> 01:26:53.126
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

01:27:02.969 --> 01:27:06.305
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:08.725
What are you wearing?

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:12.979
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

01:27:14.147 --> 01:27:16.566
- Iâ€™ve got presents?
- Yeah.

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:26.075
There they are.

01:27:37.086 --> 01:27:40.590
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:44.969
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

01:28:01.778 --> 01:28:05.490
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

01:28:05.782 --> 01:28:08.701
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

01:28:11.621 --> 01:28:12.914
Whoa!

01:28:14.123 --> 01:28:15.416
My body's gone!

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:19.212
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

01:28:19.712 --> 01:28:21.672
I'm invisible?

01:28:22.131 --> 01:28:26.552
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:31.808
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:05.758
<i>Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.</i>

01:29:05.967 --> 01:29:11.764
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

01:29:30.616 --> 01:29:32.535
Who's there?

01:29:38.624 --> 01:29:44.297
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

01:29:51.637 --> 01:29:55.433
Who is it? Show yourself.

01:30:42.605 --> 01:30:43.981
Severus, l...

01:30:44.649 --> 01:30:48.527
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

01:30:48.694 --> 01:30:53.449
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

01:31:10.675 --> 01:31:13.886
We'll have another little chat soon.

01:31:14.095 --> 01:31:19.558
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

01:31:19.809 --> 01:31:24.230
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:29.819
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

01:33:01.911 --> 01:33:03.746
Mum?

01:33:06.999 --> 01:33:09.001
Dad?

01:33:43.744 --> 01:33:48.707
Ron, you've really gotta
see this! Ron, you've gotta see this!

01:33:50.543 --> 01:33:53.379
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:57.216
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!

01:34:03.889 --> 01:34:08.227
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

01:34:09.687 --> 01:34:11.647
I only see us.

01:34:11.897 --> 01:34:15.234
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

01:34:15.401 --> 01:34:21.365
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

01:34:21.866 --> 01:34:24.201
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:28.581
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

01:34:29.748 --> 01:34:32.209
I look good.

01:34:32.835 --> 01:34:36.672
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:41.844
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:07.119
Back again, Harry?

01:35:10.247 --> 01:35:12.750
I see that you,
like many before you...

01:35:12.958 --> 01:35:17.129
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

01:35:17.463 --> 01:35:21.634
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

01:35:22.927 --> 01:35:25.471
Let me give you a clue.

01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:28.140
The happiest man on earth...

01:35:28.349 --> 01:35:31.727
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

01:35:31.936 --> 01:35:34.271
...exactly as he is.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.485
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

01:35:39.735 --> 01:35:42.488
Yes. And no.

01:35:43.489 --> 01:35:45.991
It shows us nothing more or less...

01:35:46.158 --> 01:35:52.164
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

01:35:52.373 --> 01:35:57.086
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

01:35:57.294 --> 01:36:01.173
...you see them standing beside you.

01:36:01.382 --> 01:36:03.801
But remember this, Harry.

01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:09.932
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:12.268
...or truth.

01:36:13.185 --> 01:36:19.275
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

01:36:20.317 --> 01:36:24.446
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

01:36:24.655 --> 01:36:26.532
And I must ask you...

01:36:27.533 --> 01:36:31.412
...not to go looking for it again.

01:36:32.162 --> 01:36:35.291
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:38.711
...and forget to live.

01:37:34.224 --> 01:37:39.104
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

01:37:39.396 --> 01:37:42.483
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

01:37:42.691 --> 01:37:44.693
This is light?

01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:51.700
Of course! Here it is!

01:37:51.909 --> 01:37:55.913
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

01:37:56.121 --> 01:37:57.289
The what?

01:37:57.998 --> 01:38:01.001
Honestly, don't you two read?

01:38:01.210 --> 01:38:05.714
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

01:38:05.923 --> 01:38:08.550
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

01:38:08.759 --> 01:38:12.763
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:15.140
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.

01:38:15.307 --> 01:38:17.434
I know what it means!

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:23.023
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

01:38:23.232 --> 01:38:28.404
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

01:38:30.114 --> 01:38:32.282
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

01:38:32.491 --> 01:38:37.162
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

01:38:53.971 --> 01:38:57.766
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

01:38:57.975 --> 01:39:00.686
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

01:39:01.687 --> 01:39:03.313
Oh.

01:39:05.357 --> 01:39:10.529
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?

01:39:10.696 --> 01:39:13.532
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

01:39:13.866 --> 01:39:18.078
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

01:39:18.328 --> 01:39:19.371
What?

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:23.000
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

01:39:23.208 --> 01:39:25.878
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

01:39:26.086 --> 01:39:29.965
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

01:39:30.174 --> 01:39:32.801
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.

01:39:33.051 --> 01:39:36.096
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

01:39:36.305 --> 01:39:38.390
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

01:39:38.599 --> 01:39:42.227
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

01:39:42.519 --> 01:39:46.064
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

01:39:59.912 --> 01:40:05.042
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? lt's...

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.252
I know what that is!

01:40:07.503 --> 01:40:10.130
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

01:40:10.506 --> 01:40:13.759
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

01:40:13.926 --> 01:40:18.055
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

01:40:40.285 --> 01:40:42.454
Is that...

01:40:43.288 --> 01:40:44.456
...a dragon?

01:40:44.665 --> 01:40:49.086
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

01:40:49.294 --> 01:40:52.172
My brother works
with these in Romania.

01:40:52.381 --> 01:40:57.261
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

01:40:57.928 --> 01:40:59.680
Hello, Norbert.

01:40:59.972 --> 01:41:04.309
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?

01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:07.479
Don't you, Norbert?

01:41:14.486 --> 01:41:17.614
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

01:41:21.493 --> 01:41:23.579
Who's that?

01:41:25.289 --> 01:41:27.332
Malfoy.

01:41:28.125 --> 01:41:29.501
Oh, dear.

01:41:31.253 --> 01:41:36.008
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

01:41:36.258 --> 01:41:40.304
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

01:41:40.512 --> 01:41:44.600
I don't understand. ls that bad?
- lt's bad.

01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:47.019
Good evening.

01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:53.609
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

01:41:53.859 --> 01:41:57.362
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

01:41:57.529 --> 01:42:02.451
Therefore, as punishment for your
actions, 50 points will be taken.

01:42:02.659 --> 01:42:04.995
-50?!
- Each.

01:42:06.038 --> 01:42:08.373
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

01:42:08.624 --> 01:42:11.960
...all four of you
will receive detention.

01:42:12.878 --> 01:42:15.839
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

01:42:16.048 --> 01:42:18.383
I thought you said the four of us.

01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:21.053
No, you heard me correctly.

01:42:21.303 --> 01:42:26.308
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

01:42:26.767 --> 01:42:29.728
You will join your classmates
in detention.

01:42:40.906 --> 01:42:44.910
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:49.873
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:52.918
God, I miss the screaming.

01:42:55.420 --> 01:42:58.757
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

01:42:58.924 --> 01:43:04.304
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:09.351
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

01:43:10.811 --> 01:43:15.816
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

01:43:18.068 --> 01:43:20.112
Norbert's gone.

01:43:20.696 --> 01:43:24.241
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

01:43:24.533 --> 01:43:27.786
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

01:43:27.953 --> 01:43:30.288
What if he don't like Romania?

01:43:30.455 --> 01:43:34.751
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

01:43:35.377 --> 01:43:40.632
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

01:43:40.841 --> 01:43:43.218
Got to have your wits about you.

01:43:43.427 --> 01:43:49.099
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

01:43:49.558 --> 01:43:53.145
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

01:43:54.938 --> 01:43:56.148
...werewolves.

01:43:56.606 --> 01:43:59.901
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

01:44:00.110 --> 01:44:02.779
You can be sure of that.

01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:06.158
Mighty-night.

01:44:08.744 --> 01:44:11.580
Right. Let's go.

01:44:49.785 --> 01:44:52.204
Hagrid, what is that?

01:44:52.412 --> 01:44:55.791
What we're here for.
See that?

01:44:56.291 --> 01:45:01.671
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

01:45:02.214 --> 01:45:06.802
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

01:45:14.309 --> 01:45:20.065
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

01:45:20.232 --> 01:45:23.401
- Ron, Hermione, come with me.
- Okay.

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:27.155
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

01:45:28.406 --> 01:45:30.700
Okay. Then I get Fang.

01:45:30.867 --> 01:45:36.581
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

01:45:40.252 --> 01:45:45.257
Wait till my father hears
about this. This is servant's stuff.

01:45:45.507 --> 01:45:49.427
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

01:45:49.594 --> 01:45:51.930
I'm not scared, Potter.

01:45:53.348 --> 01:45:55.267
Do you hear that?

01:45:57.853 --> 01:45:59.271
Come on, Fang.

01:45:59.479 --> 01:46:00.981
Scared!

01:46:25.964 --> 01:46:28.133
What is it, Fang?

01:47:38.495 --> 01:47:44.000
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:48.213
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:51.174
What was that thing you saved me from?

01:47:51.383 --> 01:47:56.721
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

01:47:56.888 --> 01:48:02.477
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

01:48:02.686 --> 01:48:07.732
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

01:48:07.983 --> 01:48:12.821
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

01:48:13.029 --> 01:48:14.823
A cursed life.

01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:18.994
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

01:48:19.202 --> 01:48:24.165
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

01:48:24.499 --> 01:48:28.420
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

01:48:28.628 --> 01:48:33.758
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

01:48:34.634 --> 01:48:36.177
The Philosopher's Stone.

01:48:37.595 --> 01:48:39.514
Harry!

01:48:40.098 --> 01:48:44.602
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

01:48:44.769 --> 01:48:46.938
You all right there, Harry?

01:48:48.106 --> 01:48:52.402
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

01:48:53.278 --> 01:48:57.115
You're safe now. Good luck.

01:49:04.748 --> 01:49:08.877
You mean, You-Know-Who
is out there right now in the Forest?

01:49:09.085 --> 01:49:11.880
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

01:49:12.088 --> 01:49:14.966
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

01:49:15.216 --> 01:49:19.596
Snape doesn't want the Stone
for himself. He wants it for Voldemort.

01:49:19.804 --> 01:49:24.309
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

01:49:24.559 --> 01:49:26.144
He'll come back.

01:49:26.311 --> 01:49:28.104
But if he comes back...

01:49:28.313 --> 01:49:32.317
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

01:49:33.318 --> 01:49:36.821
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

01:49:37.072 --> 01:49:40.658
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

01:49:40.825 --> 01:49:44.454
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

01:49:44.829 --> 01:49:49.709
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:55.590
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

01:49:55.799 --> 01:49:59.844
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:11.022
I'd heard Hogwarts' final
exams were frightful, but that was fun.

01:50:11.231 --> 01:50:14.859
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

01:50:15.110 --> 01:50:20.281
- My scar. It keeps burning.
-lt's happened before.

01:50:20.490 --> 01:50:23.159
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.

01:50:23.368 --> 01:50:26.871
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

01:50:34.504 --> 01:50:36.965
- Of course!
- What is it?

01:50:37.173 --> 01:50:40.885
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

01:50:41.136 --> 01:50:44.222
<i>wand a stranger 'gust happens
to have one'?</i>

01:50:44.389 --> 01:50:47.058
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

01:50:47.308 --> 01:50:49.561
Why didn't I see it before?

01:50:55.150 --> 01:50:58.653
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

01:50:58.862 --> 01:51:01.573
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

01:51:01.823 --> 01:51:04.409
You and this stranger
must have talked.

01:51:04.993 --> 01:51:08.538
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

01:51:08.746 --> 01:51:12.750
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

01:51:12.917 --> 01:51:17.422
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.

01:51:17.839 --> 01:51:22.010
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

01:51:22.218 --> 01:51:27.849
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

01:51:28.057 --> 01:51:33.521
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

01:51:35.106 --> 01:51:37.859
I shouldn't have told you that.

01:51:38.109 --> 01:51:40.320
Where are you going?

01:51:47.327 --> 01:51:50.079
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

01:51:50.538 --> 01:51:53.124
I'm afraid he's not here.

01:51:53.374 --> 01:51:57.629
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

01:51:58.087 --> 01:52:03.176
He's gone? But this is important!
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

01:52:04.969 --> 01:52:08.723
- How do you know--?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

01:52:09.349 --> 01:52:14.562
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

01:52:14.771 --> 01:52:19.067
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

01:52:27.367 --> 01:52:30.161
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:32.997
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

01:52:33.248 --> 01:52:37.126
- And with Dumbledore gone--
- Good afternoon.

01:52:39.170 --> 01:52:42.257
What would three young Gryffindors...

01:52:42.507 --> 01:52:46.803
...be doing inside on a day like this?

01:52:51.516 --> 01:52:55.103
- We were just--
- You ought to be careful.

01:52:55.645 --> 01:52:57.605
People will think you're...

01:53:01.901 --> 01:53:04.612
...up to something.

01:53:14.914 --> 01:53:16.916
Now what do we do?

01:53:17.125 --> 01:53:20.878
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

01:53:34.642 --> 01:53:36.060
Trevor.

01:53:36.436 --> 01:53:39.856
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

01:53:40.064 --> 01:53:45.528
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:49.699
- Neville, listen. We were--
- No, I won't let you!

01:53:49.949 --> 01:53:54.537
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

01:53:54.746 --> 01:53:59.042
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

01:54:07.008 --> 01:54:10.762
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

01:54:11.054 --> 01:54:14.682
Brilliant, but scary.

01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:17.393
Let's go.

01:54:17.602 --> 01:54:21.856
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

01:54:27.278 --> 01:54:31.240
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

01:54:35.119 --> 01:54:37.121
Alohomora.

01:54:49.133 --> 01:54:51.761
Wait a minute. He's...

01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:55.139
...snoring.

01:54:57.642 --> 01:55:03.147
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

01:55:04.774 --> 01:55:07.777
It's got horrible breath.

01:55:10.321 --> 01:55:12.448
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

01:55:12.657 --> 01:55:14.075
Come on!

01:55:18.121 --> 01:55:20.164
Okay. Push.

01:55:43.354 --> 01:55:46.983
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:52.196
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

01:55:52.989 --> 01:55:56.451
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:58.995
The harp.

01:55:59.662 --> 01:56:02.373
It's stopped playing-

01:56:03.791 --> 01:56:08.171
Ugh. Yuck!

01:56:12.383 --> 01:56:13.551
Jump!

01:56:25.897 --> 01:56:26.981
Whoa.

01:56:27.732 --> 01:56:31.360
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

01:56:31.527 --> 01:56:33.821
Whoa!

01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:48.878
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

01:56:49.086 --> 01:56:52.757
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

01:56:53.007 --> 01:56:58.012
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

01:57:00.264 --> 01:57:01.599
Hermione!

01:57:02.183 --> 01:57:05.937
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

01:57:06.187 --> 01:57:10.691
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:16.697
Harry!

01:57:17.782 --> 01:57:21.118
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:57:21.285 --> 01:57:24.372
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:27.124
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:30.253
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

01:57:31.128 --> 01:57:34.966
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

01:57:35.174 --> 01:57:39.554
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

01:57:39.804 --> 01:57:41.806
<i>Lumus Solem.</i>

01:57:49.939 --> 01:57:52.483
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

01:57:55.236 --> 01:57:57.697
Lucky we didn't panic.

01:57:58.447 --> 01:58:01.951
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

01:58:03.578 --> 01:58:05.079
What is that?

01:58:05.288 --> 01:58:08.958
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

01:58:22.138 --> 01:58:25.600
Curious.
I've never seen birds like these.

01:58:25.808 --> 01:58:29.437
They're not birds.
They're keys.

01:58:29.645 --> 01:58:33.107
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

01:58:36.527 --> 01:58:41.198
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

01:58:47.038 --> 01:58:49.123
Strange.

01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:51.834
<i>Alohomora!</i>

01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:57.048
Well, it was worth a try.

01:58:57.256 --> 01:59:00.509
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

01:59:00.718 --> 01:59:04.639
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

01:59:04.847 --> 01:59:08.267
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

01:59:11.854 --> 01:59:14.190
What's wrong?

01:59:15.066 --> 01:59:16.567
It's too simple.

01:59:16.776 --> 01:59:21.530
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

01:59:21.739 --> 01:59:25.284
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

01:59:42.093 --> 01:59:45.096
This complicates things a bit.

02:00:06.409 --> 02:00:08.327
Catch the key!

02:00:12.748 --> 02:00:14.625
Hurry UP!

02:00:47.158 --> 02:00:51.829
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

02:00:51.996 --> 02:00:55.166
Where are we? A graveyard.

02:00:55.583 --> 02:00:58.169
This is no graveyard.

02:01:05.676 --> 02:01:08.637
It's a chessboard.

02:01:20.608 --> 02:01:22.526
There's the door.

02:01:34.538 --> 02:01:36.040
Now what do we do?

02:01:36.457 --> 02:01:40.544
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

02:01:41.170 --> 02:01:44.924
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

02:01:45.216 --> 02:01:49.470
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.724
As for me, I'll be a knight.

02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:02.650
What happens now?

02:02:03.442 --> 02:02:06.445
Well, white moves first.

02:02:06.654 --> 02:02:08.531
And then...

02:02:10.241 --> 02:02:11.534
...we play.

02:02:22.086 --> 02:02:27.174
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

02:02:27.424 --> 02:02:30.970
...real Wizard's chess, do you?

02:02:31.345 --> 02:02:34.265
You there, d5.

02:02:48.904 --> 02:02:50.489
Yes, Hermione.

02:02:50.698 --> 02:02:55.786
I think this is gonna be
exactly like Wizard's chess.

02:03:01.709 --> 02:03:04.211
Castle to e4!

02:03:07.798 --> 02:03:10.134
Pawn to c3!

02:03:54.762 --> 02:03:58.766
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

02:03:59.016 --> 02:04:03.687
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

02:04:04.355 --> 02:04:06.690
Then you're free to check the king.

02:04:06.857 --> 02:04:09.610
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

02:04:10.194 --> 02:04:14.865
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!

02:04:15.115 --> 02:04:18.869
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

02:04:19.078 --> 02:04:22.665
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

02:04:23.165 --> 02:04:25.876
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

02:04:36.178 --> 02:04:39.098
Knight to h3.

02:05:00.035 --> 02:05:02.037
Check.

02:05:31.191 --> 02:05:32.943
Ron!

02:05:33.193 --> 02:05:38.949
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

02:05:54.048 --> 02:05:55.299
Checkmate.

02:06:15.277 --> 02:06:17.780
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

02:06:17.988 --> 02:06:21.825
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

02:06:22.076 --> 02:06:23.952
I have to go on.

02:06:24.453 --> 02:06:30.334
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

02:06:30.584 --> 02:06:33.087
Not as good as you.

02:06:33.921 --> 02:06:38.759
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

02:06:39.968 --> 02:06:45.599
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

02:07:23.679 --> 02:07:25.347
<i>You'?</i>

02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:29.977
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

02:07:30.185 --> 02:07:33.230
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

02:07:33.397 --> 02:07:36.567
Next to him, who would suspect...

02:07:36.775 --> 02:07:40.696
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

02:07:40.904 --> 02:07:46.285
But that day, during the Quidditch
match, Snape tried to kill me.

02:07:46.493 --> 02:07:49.288
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

02:07:49.788 --> 02:07:53.917
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

02:07:54.168 --> 02:07:56.378
...l would have succeeded.

02:07:56.587 --> 02:07:59.590
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

02:07:59.798 --> 02:08:02.009
Snape was trying to save me?

02:08:02.217 --> 02:08:07.556
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

02:08:07.764 --> 02:08:12.019
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

02:08:12.227 --> 02:08:15.230
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

02:08:15.814 --> 02:08:20.777
While everyone ran about, he went
to the third floor to head me off.

02:08:21.695 --> 02:08:25.199
He, of course, never trusted me again.

02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:31.455
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

02:08:31.622 --> 02:08:35.709
I'm never alone. Never.

02:08:35.918 --> 02:08:39.963
Now, what does this mirror do?

02:08:41.590 --> 02:08:43.717
I see what I desire.

02:08:44.259 --> 02:08:48.639
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

02:08:48.889 --> 02:08:51.058
Use the boy.

02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:55.771
Come here, Potter! Now!

02:09:07.866 --> 02:09:11.870
Tell me, what do you see?

02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:39.439
What is it? What do you see?

02:09:39.648 --> 02:09:44.820
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

02:09:45.028 --> 02:09:46.530
He lies.

02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:50.784
Tell the truth! What do you see?

02:09:50.993 --> 02:09:55.372
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

02:09:55.622 --> 02:09:59.626
I have strength enough for this.

02:10:17.811 --> 02:10:20.689
Harry Potter...

02:10:20.897 --> 02:10:23.233
...we meet again.

02:10:23.442 --> 02:10:24.860
Voldemort.

02:10:25.068 --> 02:10:29.031
Yes. You see what I've become?

02:10:29.239 --> 02:10:32.868
See what I must do to survive?

02:10:33.076 --> 02:10:37.205
Live off another. A mere parasite.

02:10:37.873 --> 02:10:41.209
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

02:10:41.418 --> 02:10:45.088
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

02:10:45.255 --> 02:10:48.842
But there is something that can.

02:10:49.051 --> 02:10:54.723
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

02:10:55.098 --> 02:10:56.600
Stop him!

02:11:01.688 --> 02:11:04.441
Don't be a fool.

02:11:04.941 --> 02:11:08.070
Why suffer an horrific death...

02:11:08.278 --> 02:11:11.907
...when you can join me and live?

02:11:12.115 --> 02:11:13.200
Never!

02:11:15.202 --> 02:11:19.998
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

02:11:20.749 --> 02:11:24.044
Tell me, Harry...

02:11:24.294 --> 02:11:28.131
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

02:11:28.423 --> 02:11:30.509
Together...

02:11:30.717 --> 02:11:33.261
...we can bring them back.

02:11:33.637 --> 02:11:38.392
All I ask is for something in return.

02:11:45.107 --> 02:11:48.235
That's it, Harry.

02:11:49.111 --> 02:11:52.989
There is no good and evil.

02:11:53.156 --> 02:11:56.159
There is only power...

02:11:56.410 --> 02:12:00.539
...and those too weak to seek it.

02:12:01.164 --> 02:12:06.253
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

02:12:06.670 --> 02:12:08.922
Just give me the Stone!

02:12:11.550 --> 02:12:12.676
You liar!

02:12:12.926 --> 02:12:15.053
Kill him!

02:12:38.577 --> 02:12:43.874
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

02:14:29.187 --> 02:14:31.690
Good afternoon, Harry.

02:14:33.817 --> 02:14:38.321
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

02:14:38.488 --> 02:14:44.494
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

02:14:44.744 --> 02:14:49.499
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

02:14:51.835 --> 02:14:55.505
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

02:14:55.714 --> 02:14:58.508
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

02:14:58.758 --> 02:15:01.761
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:06.850
Fine. They're both just fine.

02:15:07.434 --> 02:15:10.228
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:13.356
The Stone has been destroyed.

02:15:13.648 --> 02:15:17.861
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

02:15:18.028 --> 02:15:22.032
...and agreed it was best all around.

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:26.036
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

02:15:28.121 --> 02:15:33.627
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

02:15:33.835 --> 02:15:37.047
But yes, he will die.

02:15:37.255 --> 02:15:39.716
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

02:15:39.883 --> 02:15:42.469
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

02:15:42.677 --> 02:15:46.765
You see, only a person...

02:15:47.057 --> 02:15:50.977
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

02:15:51.227 --> 02:15:55.774
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

02:15:56.733 --> 02:16:00.236
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

02:16:00.403 --> 02:16:05.492
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

02:16:06.910 --> 02:16:12.165
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

02:16:12.374 --> 02:16:14.709
I'm afraid...

02:16:16.086 --> 02:16:20.173
...there are ways
in which he can return.

02:16:20.882 --> 02:16:23.426
Harry, do you know why...

02:16:23.677 --> 02:16:27.681
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

02:16:27.889 --> 02:16:32.519
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

02:16:33.061 --> 02:16:36.272
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

02:16:36.439 --> 02:16:40.276
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

02:16:40.443 --> 02:16:45.407
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

02:16:46.241 --> 02:16:49.953
Love, Harry. Love.

02:16:58.044 --> 02:17:02.132
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

02:17:02.382 --> 02:17:07.053
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

02:17:07.303 --> 02:17:10.598
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

02:17:10.807 --> 02:17:14.144
But I think I could be safe...

02:17:14.394 --> 02:17:16.771
...with a nice toffee.

02:17:19.482 --> 02:17:22.402
Hm, alas!

02:17:23.111 --> 02:17:25.238
Earwax.

02:17:40.462 --> 02:17:43.631
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

02:17:44.758 --> 02:17:47.469
All right. Hermione?

02:17:48.136 --> 02:17:49.971
Never better.

02:18:05.779 --> 02:18:08.198
Another year gone.

02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:13.536
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

02:18:13.703 --> 02:18:16.372
And the points stand thus:

02:18:16.539 --> 02:18:22.378
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

02:18:24.339 --> 02:18:30.011
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

02:18:35.308 --> 02:18:37.060
In second place...

02:18:37.310 --> 02:18:42.065
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

02:18:47.737 --> 02:18:49.489
And in first place...

02:18:49.823 --> 02:18:55.245
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

02:19:00.834 --> 02:19:03.044
Nice one, mate.

02:19:06.881 --> 02:19:10.969
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

02:19:11.219 --> 02:19:15.515
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

02:19:15.723 --> 02:19:20.687
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

02:19:21.271 --> 02:19:26.776
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

02:19:27.026 --> 02:19:29.779
...while others were in grave peril...

02:19:30.530 --> 02:19:32.782
...5 points.

02:19:33.700 --> 02:19:34.993
Good job.

02:19:42.709 --> 02:19:48.756
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

02:19:49.257 --> 02:19:54.512
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

02:19:59.142 --> 02:20:01.144
And third...

02:20:01.728 --> 02:20:04.606
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

02:20:04.814 --> 02:20:09.110
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

02:20:09.652 --> 02:20:14.574
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

02:20:22.832 --> 02:20:24.792
We're tied with Slytherin!

02:20:25.001 --> 02:20:31.007
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

02:20:31.174 --> 02:20:35.094
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

02:20:35.303 --> 02:20:38.264
I award 10 points...

02:20:38.473 --> 02:20:41.684
...to Neville Longbottom.

02:20:55.031 --> 02:20:58.451
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:03.206
...l believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

02:21:08.211 --> 02:21:11.631
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

02:21:13.716 --> 02:21:16.010
Yes!

02:21:31.317 --> 02:21:32.902
We won!

02:21:49.669 --> 02:21:53.006
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

02:21:53.214 --> 02:21:57.510
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

02:22:02.932 --> 02:22:06.227
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

02:22:12.442 --> 02:22:16.237
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

02:22:19.449 --> 02:22:21.284
This is for you.

02:22:38.051 --> 02:22:40.178
Thanks, Hagrid.

02:22:45.975 --> 02:22:50.438
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

02:22:50.813 --> 02:22:55.318
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

02:22:55.568 --> 02:22:58.237
...you could always threaten him...

02:22:58.446 --> 02:23:01.324
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

02:23:01.491 --> 02:23:06.621
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

02:23:07.080 --> 02:23:11.417
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

02:23:16.923 --> 02:23:20.009
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

02:23:20.259 --> 02:23:22.345
